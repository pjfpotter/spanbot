SpanBot is an app that helps Spanish teachers to design tasks for learners

The goal of this project is to make a web application that generates random sentences in Spanish using a Context Free Grammar.

Why?

Sentence Builders are a commonly used tool in contemporary high school / secondary school language classrooms. In particular due to the work of Gianfranco Conti and his advocacy for Narrow Reading and Narrow Listening in language teaching.

Language teachers following this model often need to generate numerous examples of a language pattern using a narrow range of chunks of language. These 'narrow texts' are laborious to write and there is a lack of published tasks designed in this way for teachers to use. 

A bot that can produce Narrow Texts would be a useful tool for a language teacher.

SpanBot is a narrow text generator.

Use Case 1 - I want to generate six random texts from a sentence builder to use in a piece of language task design.

Use Case 2 - I want to randomly generate 1 text live on the smart board during a lesson for use in live lesson tasks.

Use Case 3 - I want to set homework using SpanBot that helps students to memorise lexis from a sentence builder.

Disclaimer: This is my first github project and first piece of software. I'm an amateur creative coder with very rudimentary knowledge of P5.JS.
