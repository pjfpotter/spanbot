# spanbot
SpanBot is an app that helps Spanish teachers to design tasks for learners

The goal of this project is to make a web application that generates random sentences in Spanish using a Context Free Grammar.

You can see a basic version here: https://hola-amigo.glitch.me/

I want to develop this to make it into a useful tool for a working Spanish teacher.

Why?

Sentence Builders are a commonly used tool in contemporary high school / secondary school language classrooms. In particular due to the work of Gianfranco Conti and his advocacy for Narrow Reading and Narrow Listening in language teaching.

What is a Sentence Builder? Find out here: https://mrvinalesmfl.wordpress.com/2019/05/17/three-top-tips-on-how-to-make-sentence-builders-to-help-all-students-progress/

What is Narrow Reading? Find out here: https://gianfrancoconti.com/2016/08/11/how-to-design-and-use-narrow-reading-and-listening-as-part-of-an-integrated-instructional-sequence/

Language teachers following this model often need to generate numerous examples of a language pattern using a narrow range of chunks of language. These 'narrow texts' are laborious to write and there is a lack of published tasks designed in this way for teachers to use. 

A bot that can produce Narrow Texts would be a useful tool for a language teacher.

SpanBot is a narrow text generator.

Use Case 1 - I want to generate six random texts from a sentence builder to use in a piece of language task design.

Use Case 2 - I want to randomly generate 1 text live on the smart board during a lesson for use in live lesson tasks.

Use Case 3 - I want to set homework using SpanBot that helps students to memorise lexis from a sentence builder.

Disclaimer: This is my first github project and first piece of software. I'm an amateur creative coder with very rudimentary knowledge of P5.JS.
